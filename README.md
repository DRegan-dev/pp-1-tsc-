#Home Page
## Header

### The Header displays the logo, navigation toggle and navigation menu

## Main Content

### The Hero section of the homepage is comprised of a background image with some cover text that has a blur effect applied to the background

### The reasons section is comprised of a h2 heading that reads "Why Join Lininexus?", a background that has a linear gradient effect meant to represent a side profile of an illuninated flying sauce and three evenly spaced and fully responsive divs that detail the reasons these being may want to join the club. Inside these divs are headings: Sightseeing, Abduction Skills and Epic Social Events, each with a corresponding icon that when clicked will bring the user to the gallery page where they can view images of past events.

### The upcoming events section boasts a linear gradient effect acheived with keyframes that mimics the light that is used to abduct humans as would be seen in cartoons and movies in the past. The user will see a light pass in and out of the background of this section as if it is searching for someone to abduct. In front of this there are 5 vertically aligned boxes displayed in a chequered style that display the details of an upcoming event and beside it a representative image. This section is fully responsive and on smaller screens the representive image disappears leaving only the details of the event for the user to scroll through.
